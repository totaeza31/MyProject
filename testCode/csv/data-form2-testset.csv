No deckchairs by order of the Junta; umbrellas and beach mats
Patong Beach spells fun  the beach the night life and the food
a great place to be in Phuket
Plenty of activities for people
and plenty of places
Once people start to show up and the tide has had
Pros:  Lovely view calm waters clean in the mornings warm waterCons:  Dirty in the afternoons very busy no waves but most of all the sales people  
a spot opposite the Muslim burial ground which was a lot quieter than the rest of the beach and not as many sellers bothering you
I wouldn't say it's the best beach in the world but it's
Beach far too dirty surrounding
massage places too many drunken people even during the day
But its convenient there's plenty of room the jet skis and watersports are sectioned
It's a beach lie on it chill have a beer and enjoy the sunshine
overniteas part of the Princess Sapphire cruise tour of Asia
the beach was busy with tourist and there were lot of water adventure sports
ans also on the spot massages (nothing like getting a nice massage in a shaded area while there is a cool breeze to relax you)  
to enjoy and you can also get the beach chair and umbrella set up
The beach hour at this our of the day
Restaurants are available near the beach
There are thousands of people walking the streets in and out of all the bars there are lots
we tackled most the bars we had a fab time and it was
We stayed at Graceland Resort and Patong beach across the road
Kids had the luxury of pool at
While waiting for my girl to get her hair braided
The sand on the beach is ok but not as nice as the sand you get on other islands (do some day trips to other islands)
Patong beach compared to other beach spots but still very reasonable
Nice place to visit at day as well
and just enjoy the beauty
People kept coming up to us trying to sell us merchandise
We decided to hit the little shops and vendors
We didn't spend loads of time on the beach
The beach was reasonably clean the sea was very choppy
This beach is good clean soft white sand the water appears
10 metres depth is about
from the beach are many shops
Sad to see you can no longer find touts selling the lanterns but
you have to take the good with the bad
exactly in the wright place if not Phuket
They are half or one day tours to the famous beaches not fare from there
Beach Sea Facing Restaurants   Amazing Seafood & MusicBangla Street  Don't miss this  be there every evening to enjoy PatongJugceylone Mall Complex  Behind the Mall  the eating joints are excellentKairon
In different league & more beautiful  just 20 mins awayDrive to Aquarium  Southern Tip of Thailand  
Loved the beach and the whole setup with stalls and music and tuktuk and the whole atmosphere was just great  
Had one of the pancakes from a street vendor
Visited during the day when it was not too busy and
The further away from Bangladesh Road the quieter and less crowded it was  
Crowded all day time many motorize and non motorize activity price it high some times and all services
you can pay
my hotel there so spent
Nice beach warm sea restaurants around waterports available sun chairs available
If you want not see the Patong Beach you haven't see the Phuket
Everything goes in this place from
my stay there so I have nothing to comment on the activities
However on my last evening in Phuket we happened to walk along the road lining the beach and the sunset was absolutely beautiful
Loved the lounges on the beach the massages and the friendly locals
Walk down to the beach after lunch and then just relax by the beach get a massage once
you need go to the beach it s famous beach but is
a good moment good restaurants bars and others can do jet sky  walking and enjoy the sun
All famous food chains ( KFC Burger King McDonalds Pizza Company) have their
Cash is only accepted at most of the places and one can find plenty
I went to Patong Beach on Saturday night and the street was full
of people walking and watching the excellent bands singing
The beach is just perfect at every aspect
And the temperature of the sea water can't be more comfortable
a warm sand and watching everybody having good time at the beach
The beach was clean and water was clear
The parasols and sunloungers have been banned so all
the usual things like makeshift bars
Great time we had so much fun
to have fun locals and tourists  always a good sign when locals attend!!!
It's clean nice sand
times boats for para sailing were getting too close or too many people selling stuff it's a great beach
We walked to the water at night & it's almost completely deserted; apparently
 all the crowds go to the craziness of Bangla Road at night  
rides beware tho 1500 baht in the am down
to 1100 baht in the pm for parasailing so do not over pay
be looked after all day by katut!
LOved the endless cocktails beers and roaming hawkers selling
You can rent an umbrella for some respite from the sun and the beach vendors are always
marked area though as the jet skis and boats are
Patong beach was pretty cool The currents were pretty strong to swim but we could attribute
What was not so favorable was the people every 5 minutes coming by to try and sell
Hire a beach chair and umbrella for the day and watch the world go by
adjacent to the beach to go and explore
drinks to excellent sea food cooked on the beach by friendly local traders
The ultimate beach for the day every day
as we had been to many other beaches in Phuket
There were some water activities too happening around there but it was not disturbing
other beaches on the West coast of Phuket  Patong is not the best 
Nice water and the mountains around the beach are beautiful but the overcrowding on the beach and the locals permanently trying to sell
of activity during the day  with jet ski  parasailing  masseurs
Sunset is great time to go to take in the great view
Unruly dirty and hot it is typical of many similar destinations throughout Asia
Full of bars and bad restaurants not to mention the hassling touts it is
If you got ntg to do u must walk along the patong beach
You never go hungry to bed
In my opinion there are far too many boats and jet ski's in the water now and towards the left side
a swim and looking at the fish on the left side they seem
A great spot to chill out and enjoy the sun and water
also to do a bit of shopping whilst your there
It's a long and broad beach of pristine and very white sand
you want it and you probably will at some stage
Every kind of beach and sea activity is available making
Did so much here
Really good for a swim paragliding ski doo banana boayou name it
Wanna go back soon!
has everything from Jetsking to SUP on offer  walk towards the ends of the beach to find empty spots everyone
also located at the centre plus the best patong beach sign is located towards the north end of the beach
Many huts on the beach
to use on the beach
Good beach to walk along for exercise and view the scenery
Beautiful beach to relax  
There is also jet skiing and hang gliding if that is your thing  
Would definitely do this again
water scooter rides jet skiingpara sailing lots of  eateries and cafes and with tonnes of local
The beachfront is well developed and well managed and you will never be bored
We found the area around the beach to be very filthy and smelling a bit foal with waste piled up in black bags
or just strewn around
There are different types of restaurants bars pubs!
Lot of thing to do during night!
Beautifully clean there is a no smoking policy in place on the beach now but plenty of smoking areas
The chicken kebabs and the potato skewers are lovely
Easy to find food and drink in the surroundings
Very convenient for Beach lazing in the morning
Plenty of shops bars restaurants and night clubs
The beach itself is lovely with soft sand and plenty of activities on offer
it's clean and has bluegreen waters and clean white sand but because
of restaurants closer to beach activities in beach street food people massages and what not
There are many restaurants along the beach which offers a variety of food and drinks you can chose a restaurant based on your budget  enough options are available
Water sports are exorbitantly expensive only try it if
If you decide to go for water sports
Its a beautiful beach day and night warm as a bath!not
to busy!only downfall is all the rubbish on the beachbit gross!
Though it is a nice beach you will not get
After the first 10 times saying no you start to become irritated
Very nice beach liked it best in the early morning
for a cost as is food and drink including alcohol
I went to Patong to see and experience what others said about it
I was there I was disappointed because I saw bottles of beer and wine in the beach
a good exercise & fresh breeze took some photos and went back to the hotel
"A Finnish author once called tourism ""coast cancer"""
Of course the beach is beautiful but far too busy to my taste
Awesome beach but rubbish everywhere mainly plastic
Great place to watch the sunset with a cold beer
If you read reviews and think Patong will be to busy for you  I would look at
At the southern end of the beach is a fishing village  You
There are vendors everywhere selling all sorts of food and drink and you can rent chairs on which to sit or lay
as well with all the clubs and restaurants and street food til late at night
Patong beach is a sight to see with lots of restaurants bars shops hotels massage parlours and loads of street food of all varieties
The beach itself was disappointing and had significant amount of litter on the beach and in the sea
This is a nice beach with
Order drinks and get them brought
The sand is SO SO soft and the water is a great temperature (might be nice if it were
under trees along the edge of the beach and that worked great
Patong Beach is beautiful
or just relax on the beach
Nice for taking a stroll  we didn't swim here waves were big when we visited
Lots happening on the beach front  parasailing
Rented a beach chair for 100baht and get
Still it is a nice beach to relax and was
Findig on the main night club road while you see everything and every kind of people walking the streets;  
The seafood restaurants are okay but the noise from the street take away any ambiance
Water not so clear but very calm!
Nice to see sunrise here and also after party!
The location of Patong Beach is good  so many options to eat shop and if the weather is good go to the beach  when we went the streets
werent overly crowded so it was good
Nice beach a few people swimming lots of people sunbathing didn’t get to swim in water
Beaches are always nice anyway
effort was made to keep everything clean and open
A massive clearup has taken place of unlicensed sun bed businesses and it does make the area more attractive
be that much clear but it was decent nice place to spend time with your companion there are option of water sports
try this place if ur in phuket as its a must visit not just because of beach but
I have been to Patong Beach Bangla road (walking street) many times in the past few
the people watching and live bands in some of the bars
A woman came from behind on the crowded street and tried to pick pocket my wallet she was not successful but it
It’s 200 valid for the whole day
also pass by and offee food and drinks
are available starting from 30 baht
A great place to sit in one of the many beach side bars
If you want peace and tranquillity there are many less busy beaches
I shopped both in the Jung Ceylon Centre and in the street shops
and ended up getting locked in an airconditioned room with
my money so I bought lots of DVDs and they all work!
Walk to Patong Beach before sunset and enjoy the parasailing
a lot of restaurant and Thai street food around
This beach is really nice relatively clean with sun loungers and water
but watched others go parasailing jet ski banana boat wake board and waterski etc
beachplenty going on herelots of hawkers selling just about everythinga simple no thanks and they go awaya pretty clean
placenice sand and a lovely view
water was clear great swimmingand a nice few lazy days with great weather
new years when the sky is lit up and the sand is packed with people from all over the world having a good time
Unfortunatly the beach itself is a bit dirty and not the most
Warm water patrolled and plenty to look at
It's also close to restaurants and the madness of Bangla are
"pros: easy access big beach many beach activities and sportscons: waters not clear overly crowded expensive not quite the ""island beach experience"" one would hope"
to get when on an island!
The northern end of the beach is the quieter end of the beach
This beach is not as quiet and beautiful as Nai Harn beach but
You go here expecting all of this and the Beach didn't disappoint
It's always lively right up to the early hours of the morning
you the blend of relaxation and enjoyment
During day enjoy the amazing breeze and night is the time for clubbing
This stretch of beach represents Phuket to the world even though Phuket
We stayed at Avista Hideaway at the south end uphill of Patong
Good shoppingboth branded and unbrandedgood food courtveg options available
Many restaurants alsojust opposite Bangla eoad
Very good beach with lot of fun activities nearby Bangla Road
Offers lot of food and drinks options along
and restaurants and bars to go to
The beach is not far at all from the happening spot
Very well maintained irrespective of such a high turnover of tourists
You go and just relax and dont
I recommended walking along for the sunrise in the morning
or even having dinner at the restaurant on the beach during sunset
Patong Beach is so happening great place with smiling
for tourist take pics is too disgusting
 the seller helped us by setting up extra umbrellas to provide more shade and made sure he brushed off any sand even the sand from our own feet
also lots of restaurants and markets near the beach and we found some great little shops selling good shirts for 150 baht
Full of tourists the beach gives a spectacular view of the sea sand and nature
The beauty at its best
We visited it on daylight and I can only imagine what happens after sunset
"Place for ""party people"""
I could do without but the water is beautiful the beach is beautiful and you can walk across the street to the shops
only steps away from a splash in the ocean
Hotels Restaurant Shops and Bars this place come in it's
If you like water sports do visit water is pretty clean
After one week i came back in the early morning after working out because i wanted to swim
and perfect weatherthe water is warm and clean
Has a nice view and the water was so warm
Best part is unlike most of the beaches in Mexico or the Virgin Islands there were no hustlers trying
Good water sport
Good breezy wind beach
Food stalls umbrellas and chairs for hire massages on the beach 
for tourists but for more beautiful beaches travel north to Khao Lak
Living within about a hundred meters of Patong party street and the beach made
millions of motorbikes and tuktuks passing by and much much more 
We went to the beach everyday and despite some bad comments
we found it to be clean and pleasant everytime
a place for young travellers or old men picking up lady boys
The vibe is pumping and buzzing if that's what u want 
Had amazing time while staying in phuket with friends a lot of entertainment is in
patong beach  different activities like jetski parasailing bnana ride and many more 
a massage manicure peticure lying in the sun from a beautiful
few hawkers on the beach but not pushy
awesome time great for a hot day awesome surfing and relaxing
this is one of the best beaches
The beach is not clean and too crowded
throws rubbish in the provided bins things might be better
It was simply too hot to hang around the beach when we went and truthfully with the crowd and the bustle of endless watersports etc this wasnt the most alluring beach option there was
a calm and slightly quieter sitting and relaxing but really nothing worth writing home about
need to hire a deck chair
A good place to walk and see the sunset
Had a great time with my young kids
They enjoyed the beach and breeze
Many people miss the sun beds I get that but after years of not going
I now look at it and think it's beautiful
the color of the ocean the view the freedom
 have made this place one of the best
to the town happenings and food outlets
Wide range of food in terms of choice & price
If you are there on a clear day you can
If you love quiet beaches Paradise and Freedom beaches are a better bet
The beach itself is clean and has so much nearby restaurants bars and water activities
The sea however is a dirty murky green with all sorts floating in it and a LOT of sea weed so for that reason I would prefer
to the beach; loads of restaurants
are available on the other side of the roads
Good place for swimming n water sports
evening time after 6 PM
The tender chicken in the butter
we usually miss out of our town and the yummiest food we could ask
Tourists dot the beach under hired umbrellas and mats   
to bities in the water
Australia we are spoilt for having the most beautiful beaches in the world
don't come to Patong for the beaches they come here to experience the night life and the craze shopping and to relax by the pool
It was so much better with chairs and tourist sitting by the beach
Maybe due to the water sports activities
or spent time enjoying the warm sun warm waters and friendly atmosphere created by the many beach goers
the crowds to be very respectful and the noise level
serve you drinks and put your umbrella up and down and move
This beach isnt as clean as the more secluded beaches in Thailand but was still nice to go and have
Clean and usable and quite kid friendly
a hit and everyone enjoyed it but a lot of bargaining is a must
Get used to saying no thanks and don't try to sleep on the beach as some one will wake you
Massages are the best and the people are beautiful
If you want quiet you can have it
If you want non stop party it is here
Nice  very calm and relaxing beach
canbe chiled with few beer bottles and snacks   blue water and golden sand
The Boardwalk goes all the way along the beach to Bangla Road and further
Peppering of casual restaurants all the way along
The beach and water could be cleaner
Nice vibe and everything but not the tropical paradise that
for 2 weeks and walked the entire length on a daily basis
you want clean sand good swimming freshly prepared food and endless peoplewatching then
The beach vendors are polite and do not hassle
you want to miss the rusha good time for jogginghowever a little later the activities really kick inloads to do and see
guard at the crosswalk will help
excellent especially on weekends when the night
hours just sitting and watching  lantern lighting was unique and thoroughly enjoyed it !
Patong beach was beautiful  however every turn
We much preferred Karon beach  the water was cleaner and the beach was quieter
Has many bars and eateries and shops
"When your not being hassled by copy watch sellersor people wanting you to go to their ""night""shows etcyou can get a decent feed"
This is one of the many crazy places in Thailand  
them but skip this one and head to Pattaya  
To me this area of Phuket is worth missing  
Warm water but not very
Nice pictures to take in the evening (sunset)
Nice sandy beach shadow restaurants drink sellers everywhere lot of possibility of leisure activities
The beach and water are beautiful!
to hide under so get there fast to pick
Lots to look at and lots to do at night
I thought they were hookers at first but its a clever way to get men into the bars and spend more money
The best time to visit the beach is in the morning near 8am to 12pm
So take a hotel near the beach to enjoy the sea
The beach is clean and well kept
This is one of the best spots in the world to view the sunset
The most beautiful sunset
to stay during the day and also in the evening when you can see the sunset
You need to pay BHT 100
for each beach chair which I think it
you are sunbathing for a whole day
and plenty of activities if you wanted to partake
a little pushy with regards to you hiring some of their wares so if
Excellent sands and warm clean waters
Really lovely beach but very crowded but
Patong Beach is the logest beach in Phuket
a lot of activities like Jet Ski Rental Service
Cheap drinks at the beach bars
100 baht per bed for all day
The endless streets of shops stands and bars is what makes it cool
The beach is a bit dirty (litter etc) and the sea doesn't look to
The beach was across the road from our hotel
The usual watch and sunglasses sellers walking about trying to make a living
a nice breeze to keep you coolNot as picturesque as Krabi beach but still very relaxing
Nice beach with chair and umbrella facilities for rent much activity such as jet ski an para sailing  
you stuff you don't want !!
Absolutely loved Patong and everything it offers
Clean  save and lots to see and do
Fun cheesy and busy

The beach itself is quite pretty and the swimming good
Lots of cruise ships jet skis and parasailing happening here

A postcard beach that looks great to look at
Found a handful of plastic within an hour
I’m guessing that can be found almost
Paring beach is nice with
Thai and tourist enjoyed themselves there
It was extremely busy lots of panhandlers the waters isn’t the bluest and there aren’t
I will say there’s a lot of water activities restaurantsbars and things to do
release your stress free your mind every minutes count
smell the fresh air from ocean
play with the small waves nearby
Lots of bars restaurants gogo bars (erotic show bars)
If you are looking for romantizm you are at the wrong place
My wife and I visited Patong Beach during the evening hours during our honeymoon and we had a blast
We stayed in the nice quite resort of The Shore and visited
DThe beach is lovely water is always nice and warm 
Laying on the beach and having easy access to cocktails and icecream was great!
beach but very dirty we were too scared
to swim in the waterWe expected more based
you like hustle and bustle  
Very busy and crowded  
Awesome food cold drinks  
to enjoy the calm and relaxation that comes with an island
The beach itself is beautiful but for quality relaxation take a scooter and explore
beach!The sand is white and the water is clear!
Would recommend a visit to this beach just stay away from the con men!
Patong Beach is
And also a place to relax with
Resting all year round 
You have the beach which is full
than the bars off the beach
The beach is very beautiful and during this season there aren't that many tourists
you something and some of them are
Patong beach was ok not best in area reminded me of Kuta in
ladies doing braids in saying that
Lots of water activities are offered at beach
Para surfing jet ski banana boat etc are some of the main activities
very nice and free
If you're planning to celebrate NYE at in Phuket then be at this beach
with fireworks and sky lanterns open air DJ and a night of revelry
lighted because of the lanterns being released
by tourists giving a beautiful view in the area
The beach was big and there were a lot
so it is not the most relaxing place to be
The swings and hammocks along the beach are great but the shops
on the opposite side are a bit too pushy
nice clean beach good for
better negotiate the price with the guys
who rents jet skis
my stay in Patong Beach
Compared to the rest of Thailand it's rather expensive the food is more international
Lots of great water sports and activities
Street food shops not too far and open after sun set
Great beach and there are restaurants  bars and number of activities
Beautiful scenery around the beach
Not much crowded enjoyable with families
I had a partial view of the beach from the balcony of my room and the view is spectacular!Patong Beach
One can expect to have a lot of fun on the beach!There are people who will walk along the beach to ask the visitors if they are interested
Patong Beach was very enjoyable especially swimming in the warm Andaman waters
Not so great was the constant bombardment of vendors selling trinkets & other services
Patong Beach is not white sands and blue water actually its a bit dirty on the beach but if your looking
best sunsets i would not go anywhere else
We love it here many thing to do and just next to our hotel near the Patong beach
we will be back here on our nest holiday
it takes away the tranquillity of the
a great beach its clean and stunning on the eye definitely the best attraction in Patong
as before  even couple year ago I visited
You can feel everything like before
January 2017 its really busy there are boats with people flying up in the sky off them banana boats jet skies people selling items bars and food places  
of life lots to keep you entertained but is not relaxing
If you go to patong go at night when you can go on the streets and get food and people watch and see all the crazyness that goes on at night
Also the taxi all claim they have no meter so they all give you a price so make sure you
Food and drink prices are reasonable
Can be an ideal place for looking the sunset
a visit since its smack in the centre of patong
as you make your way to bangla street for clubing in the evening
the course of the day
lifeguard cover 5 times the distance on a beach in the UK
However it is crowded and
out around our resort pool
A vast stretch of the beach which is visited by one and all
who come to phuket
Bang la street being
near this beach
is always crowded
I was many times here stuff SONNY (watch pic)
care about drink and food best coctail
Clean beach and not very crowded
Has lots of food carts and activities along the beach walk way
buy cold drinks right on the beach hire a jet ski or parasailing a few hawkers but nothing like Bali and they don't hassle you if
A few really nice beach bars right on the beach (Bikinni Bar was fun and cheap)  
One of the happening place where u can spend the whole day from morning sunrise to sunset with sun bath lots of water activity
Clean beach with loads of water sports On the beach Massage shacks
Patong being one of the biggest beaches of Phuket
This beach is long but not that wide so all people end up
to even dip my feet in that water however the surrounding area is fill of shops restaurants bars real massage spas
and Tuk Tuk and opt to take the bus
The beach itself is lovely and very easy to reach
Along the beach you will find some bars and restaurants
Good beach and can find spaces
has lifeguards and is in great location for quick access to street food shops
Patong Beach is the place to be
The only bad point is the constant hassle by the massage and other sales
Enjoyed spending time on the beach  relaxing and sunbathing!  
Beach bars  great service around
You will find many night clubs (with and without girls) tourists from around the world and really the place to party
a hotel on the way to Kamala there are stonescorals in the water so not ideal to go into the water
Beautiful place for a evening walk lovely view of sunsetnice view of the beach road
a must visit place for everyone
Not much waves peaceful seapara sailing and speed boats available on the beach
It was like a warm pool
You're able to rent a chair and umbrella for THB100
for as long you'd like to use it for the day
You have the usual beach vendors
 but they are nowhere near as persistent as for example Bali
of restaurants and shops for tourists you can find everything there
But like beach is crowded and really dirty 
a 50mtr walk form the streets 
just loved every bit of it 
Clean Shallow beach well
marked swimming areas lifeguard beautiful view of the sea beach chairs umbrellas and water sports activities are available
the beach was fun to go to you can get food drinks massages right on the beach
type bars and also the start to the bangola road where it's
Water sports beach chair and umbrella hire massage cold drinks and food
Everything you need for a day at the beach!There is a vast difference between high and low tide with
Lots of people lots of partying
Rent a lounge chair and umbrella
the road from the beach and it was perfect to go walking along here daily
I decided to give parasailing a go on my last day after seeing it and it was quite the experience  
the harness and parachute on me not speaking English and not explaining what was happening until the last second
buy the fireworks on sale on the street and set them off on the beach at all hours waking people up in the hotels
They are large fireworks that make a massive boom
Every where u can see something going on
Juggling water sports etc Sports are little on higher side in
Enjoyed the beachdissapointed there were no sun
beds and umbrellas there all been taken away so not much shade and no drink stands on the beach
Well as I like to eat everywhere else
Leky near from the south part of Patong Beach and road
The pic is the famous entrance to Bangla
the peak season and it the vendors are irritating  
711(across the street) and you will pay 14 of the prize  
for night life drink party just come here
also very busy and crowded feeling like
Pataya many seller walk on the beach try to selling
you many things that overprice
a price of art  then a corn on the cob then a bikini  then ray bans ( cheap cheap lol)Then some sort of charity begging
We sat for half hour and was getting cheesed off with being mithered so decided to go and sit in a bar on the beach front
Patong Beach apparently is the most visited beach in
Right outside the beach is the patong market which is nice with a variety of things
The other good place to visit in phuket is
the shopping mall the jungcelonprices at the street
the beach is very serene with little bit of water sports
walkable distance from most of the hotels
It was clean despite be such a popular destination and even though they say its not the pretty
the views was beautiful and water just perfect
to relax and ride the wave then patong beach is the right place
you need to pay 150 thai baht if you want to use a tent nearby the beach
We found this beach overcrowded which wasnt so much of a problem as the fact that a local river runs
Although it looks beautiful and the water was crystal clear during parts of the day
all day every day lots of people bothering you
you some peace of mind however if you want
So many people everywhere always busy and it was very
from different walks of life come together down this street!
great for massages water sports restaurants in other side of road  lots of street food
a quick bite to eat 
 also watch out for sand flies  insect repellent definitely needed  use 711 and boots the pharmacy cheaper than the street stalls  I used Tiger Balm for repellent and after bite care only 100 bht in
boots for large  use the white Balm not so hot
a warm ocean and bath in the sun to enjoy yourself
A lot of shops and restaurants across the beach are also a tourist attraction
We stayed at the Fishermen's Harbour (about 510 walk from the beach)  
I would stay across the street from the beach
Patong beach is the main beach of Phuket so expect a lot of hustle
For nicer beaches and lesser crowds head to Kata beach or Nai Harn beach
I enjoyed the walks on the beach not the cleanest of beaches or the nicest just convenient having it
so close to the hotel but never spent any
It's probably not the nicest beach but it's the closest
The water is not perfectly clear but still nice and it's
The beach walk is nice easy  
and market stalls along the beach walk  
we found them very attentive and worth the 100 Baht we paid per chair
On our second day there we were attacked by lice in the water so we stayed out after that
I have no words for this beautiful beautiful place
's probably because the waters are not too deep and does not require one to

The sea is warm and plenty of water sports

I liked the warm water and seeing all the activities such as paragliding fishing and jet skiing
The sunsets were spectacular!  
Heaps of things to see & do during the day & a gorgeous sunset at night!
so much rubbish in the sand
Plenty of space and can even hire a back rest and umbrella
When you first walk on the beach lots of people asking if you want
This is one of the more popular beaches so its almost always crowded
a great place to meet people not the most ideal
The beach is clean and you can just hang there
While the restaurants along the beach the food and price was good

There is a police station near this beach and its
Water clear and clean beautiful sand characteristic of beaches on the west side of the island
to our preference Kata Noi our overall favourite with Nai Harn a close second
Probably the busiest of the beaches in Phuket a long stretch of nice beach with loads going on

to get around but it takes a couple of days
Great food we had food here everyday during our stay in
The service was great and the Manager  Mr Mann was very helpful
waters are not that cleancrowded best avoided as far
as the beach is concerned unless you want to indulge in the

nicer beaches in the world but it is a nice beach
If you go to Patong please go here
beds to sit on by the beach and pool side resturant it is just a must
Like many places in Thailand it is overpriced overrated and underdeveloped
It is also a bit dirty
As you look out to sea go far right to the end   
Kelly hotel by bike taxi or fifteen minute walk   
Very busy beach in phuket and more activity to do and working distance
nice cafes and lot of market and pubs
it was crowded and overflowed with people
If you like club hopping drinking etc this is the place you will be satisfied
The stroll down the patong street is quite interesting 
Lots of road side eateries and stalls specially for sea food lovers
I spent alot of my time in thailand on this beach just hanging out with
the people trying to sell you literally everything  its a gorgeous place to be
to have fun with your family and friends and enjoy water sports
and great atmosphere
to travel much further or
and skillets and boats that ruins the whole atmosphere of a holiday
You will some beach activities over here but it is very costly
If you want to swim & do snorkelling in beach this is not the right place
and tourists with such a disregard for the environment   
of pushy vendors walking by with high
you should walk along the patong beach and enjoy a nice wind in the beach
There are so many kind of restaurant
If you like to be in the centre of all the action then this is the place to be
The walk along the beach is shaded and the streets running off the main roads are packed
Impressed that it’s mostly no smoking with seperate smoking areas
Swimming is safe with areas
The beach was chaotic at times with so much going on

Patong beach is probably the most famous beach in Phuket
an hour walking down the beach or just laze around under a beach umbrella
I have been in Phuket in

Umbrellabeach bed was quiet affordable

Relax and enjoy the water eat and drink and of course get the Ice Cream
I just had a walk around did not go swimmingalso spent the evening in Patong area
The area is overcrowded and not relaxing at all
Patong beach is quite long and it was low season so it wasn't crowded at all
Sand is soft and the water is nice and warm
has long walking way which is great but unfortunately it is dirty ( plastic bottles wooden pieces sea plants washed out etc)
Probably because we went to Phuket in the raining season it is not possible
words cant describe how awesome this place is
so many clothes shoes and bags good food and nice people
my husband and i loved the beach the sand and the sunset
and im surprised its so clean
who just leave all there rubbish
after eating and drinking
We visited Patong Beach several times to shop relax and to grab a drink
The area is amazingly beautiful and the people are the most amazing  friendly
We enjoyed the convenient location of this beach
We were able to walk most places from our hotel
We love watching everyone walk up and down the beach
thai people walking up and down the beach with chicken shrimps rice and fruit
Been to Thailand Bangkok Phuket and Phi Phi Islands but i would vouch for my days at Phuket they were so awesome
so welcoming and so full of life a lot of activities around the beach

or any other tours if you'd like
You get lots of restaurants facing the beach
We tried at two of them and the food was good
I had been to beach for few hours only it has all water sport activities
has many hotels nearby and all restaurants
This is a cool beach with great beach activities eg ski boats parasailing
Drinks also available on the beach
very crowded and hot
a short taxi drive away like Kata beach
Great weather amazing views and offcoirse leads
to colorful walking Street
Great food options
a very long Beach we walked from one end to the other which took us about
1 and half hours lots of sunbeds beautiful water
us to visit this beach and since the hotel has a shuttle we decided to go
The beach is not clean at all full of vendor and with lots of tourist if you really want
Every visitor to Patong must make the walk along Patong Beach
of the lounge chairs and tents along the white sands
Very sporty paragliding speed boats water sports long boats there's loads to do
to rush down early morning with your beach towel !!!
The beach itself is very nice and long but given the high
The Patong area it's overrated in my opinion
Great spot and the water is absolutely breathtaking
can be annoyed by touts but all in
Plastics of all descriptions bottles bags and wrappers being spewed from the mouth of the beautiful Andaman Sea
If the other visitors to the beach could just do a small
Great atmosphere fantastic when sea breeze comes in
Food was great and prices were excellent even including alcohol
It is very large beach
means there is a lot action around this place
Been to Patong beach only one day i was doing

A beautiful bay which we pulled into on the Ovation of the Seas  
We parked there all day and did on shore excursions  
The beach was filled with all walks of life we found the beach very clean the water warm and people
All in all the beach was lovely
Loads happening during the day including jet skis and parasailing or simply
The perfect place to sit and watch the sunset over the water
Patong beach is too sedate for the avid beach goer
On the extreme right hand side of the beach ( if
you are standing facing the ocean ) there is a small shack on the rocks  that
Plenty of drinks fresh fruit ice cream places in the area to keep you cool
Hotels around the area are incredibly close to the beach
nice clean so fun  many sport activity  peaceful  all people are nice and friendly 
for couples families and solos
Bars upon bars upon bars!
If you are in the area at night then
As we were in Patong we had an obligatory walk down the beach which had few shady tree places where there were no vendors who otherwise occupied most of the beach front
Evening time was a cacophony of blaring music with bored pole dancers and heavily
for walks on the beach and the amount of rubbish left over from previous
The Thai people are just wonderful and so respectful and the guys
between the times of 11am  5pm
The waves and breeze are amazing late in the day
The beach is very busy and crowded yet still fun  
you definitely people watch and there is a lot to see  
markets food hotels motor bikes
buy with taxis buses bikes food stalls just the best place ever will be going
Touristy beach with the usual activities like parasailing  
Clean and near to shops plenty of eating places and nightlife area
The bargaining was fun and I started at about 13rd of the asking price and negotiated to a settlement of just above 50% in most cases
As time was short we made the most of looking and comparing prices as we were going to the  night markets
an early evening and I really had fun
for crowds and hubbub (like Hooters and Hard Rock Cafe type experience
but having lots of services around
you to try out a thai massage  and relax on a sunbed in the beach
Patong beach  the largest and most busiest of all the Phuket beaches
Lined with coconut trees next to the highway overlooking hotels and motels is the most beautiful beach in Phuket
I Their early 20s and looking to party constantly but if
you are looking for peace and quiet while enjoying the beaches of Thailand I'd recommend staying closer to Kata Noi or Laem Singh
You will be mesmerized by the colorful lights music and food
to walk because this road is unaccesible at night
Plus its more fun to walk around and get lost
here is near the bar n restaurant
for tourists to doromantic for couple to walk along the beach
The food in and around the area is nice lots of bars
to keep hydrated and the shopping is plentiful
If you go to Phuket must stay at
Bangla road is very very very busy at night
I personally liked this beach because it is long enough to make
30 mins run (to the end and back) not too many people if you go and leave early and the water is
wet the sand is clean and the ppl are nice
you on sand and drop you off on the sand so you do not get wet
Many resorts and hotels nearly the beach
I was there on Festival Water and Thai new year
I am very happy
to stay here and want to come back again good staff helpful excellent service on main beach road
We went on the tours during the day and Bangla Road at night
we went to check out the other people and what ever the vendors are selling
We had a few walks along the beach and swam
The beach could be beautiful but is
unfortunately full of sunbeds brolleys and watersport hire companies
big beach with clear water
The fencing trees provide required shade
day time so you can enjoy it all day round
less but swimming experience is good
patong beach one of famous beach in phuket n most crowded spots
a buzy night life lots of choices for pub  club
Probably because of low season it was very dirty
Nice place for culinary experience on night market and cheep shopping!
price is 13 of what they say in the start
One can walk along the road beside beach
from one end of the patong beach
The first time to Patong was about 25 years ago
You will have some good and cheap finds just know how to bargain so you will not be another tourist
Maybe it is in low season not many people in the beach
Since it is too hot even dog takes a nap under surf board!
This beach is good if not compared with Maya BayBamboo Islands
Paragliding is very expensive covering less than 5 minutes!
One of the things that is so expected and it is
By the way a lady in the hotel i was staying in was convinced she had a real

By the way the tong yum we have ordered we told them a little bit spicy came out super spicy!
Baby it's got it all!
Sand is soft and water is warm
watching people having relaxing massage enjoying the waters doing water sports
During my visit it was not so crowded
On our first day we couldn't believe the rubbish coming in with the tide
we tried Patong again very little rubbish and the beach looked great in the sunshine
the main route which is full of small 'market' shops trying to sell
We walked back roads to the Holiday Inn to catch our shuttle back to the other Holiday Inn and came across a small
Sit back relax and watch the world go by as you enjoy a drink from the well stocked and varied bar served by quality staff
Was a nice clean beach and the water was warm
me was being repeatedly harassed for a massage by the ladies near the Patong Beach sign
as you want to once you've paid  there is no fixed hour system which is good
The beach water is clear and the underlying surface
The beach itself is lovely and clean I stayed for a week and saw the beach cleaned every morning
a good swim get some great food by the beach then hang out with your mates under an umbrella with a few cold ones what could be better
Safe walking did not get too tired
as I could stop for massage and go on walking
Relax on the beach watch a perfect sunrise or sunset whilst having a relaxing massage
The water is absolutely divine
Very well kept and clean with plants that make it beautiful and give pleasant shade
Along the nearby road there are many shops with drinks lunch and objects for tourists
two spots  and of course there are all the water sport options
I did not spend time on the beach this visit  if you
The place is full of pubs
and offcourse street shopping one need to spend atleast
I'm actually not a big “let's go down to the beach and go for a swim
Surprisingly it is very touristy so expect it to be packed during high season
Good beach lot of people many restaurants little crowdy but fun atmosphere
Beach is next
for tourists preferring quite place
on Patong Beach on

beautiful clean sandy beach clear calm  waters with lots of bars and food places along
the sea front
excellent place clean sand a lot of sunbeds the staff around is very friendly there a lot of activities to do
A lot of bars  from where you can buy drinks
Although be aware whether the tour company is licensed or not because there are many unlicensed tour operators
The beach is super crowded and the water doesn't look like it's the cleanest plus with all
easily accessible family friendly we enjoyed it very much and felt
safe at all times Traffic is quite hectic in the surrounding area lots of vendors selling intresting goods
This beach is not the best in phuket
It is location is amazing
I went to it only once during my stay
This beach is a little bit too busy if
for a relaxing break Personally speaking i wouldn't trust the guys renting out the jet ski's
The place is full of tourist
Full of shops and activities
I guess they have to cater for everyone's needs
Patong but the beach itself is great
the quietness of the beach
Patong beach is not the best place to be
Its a beautiful and clean beach but its very crowded
to the hotels in the patong area so people staying in
Patong during the monsoon season (May until september) and you like
The surf school is on the north end of Patong beach
If you want to take lessons the surfinstructors are ISA certified
and fun for everyone
Great vibe along the street and entertainment
Patong is beautiful long and wide beach with great sand and shady palms
It is placed along busy road so do not expect silence and tranquility or relaxation  
very crowded too expensive to get a sunbed
or a fine given to you
you want everything in one place then its the place to be
Then just across the beach road many shops and eateries you can hop out
Nice long open beach with adjoining
Beach is clean and probably the best and most buzzing in Phuket
Despite there are a lot of buzzing activities the seaactivities provided are about the same
Nonetheless nice sea view
you could rent a space on the sand where the locals
As you walk the beach or rest on the sand you will be approached by locals selling gear
Its much more our scene than up the road more
Its peaceful and not much rubbish around
Patong beach of Phuket is a very happening place
90 percent of Earth planet is secluded but places like
The sand is full of plastic bags bottles paper wrappers and all sorts of rubbish and the Ocean is the same (as thats where the rubbish is washing up from)
but the water is also brown in color from all the gutter and sewerage that washes from the land out
Good beach but very crowded and not
Very hot but drinks readily available
Patong beach is a lovely beach really white sand and clear waters it really is like a tropical beach
by people trying to sell you watersports although it does not take the beauty away from the surroundings
you want to find a magic place!
but too much noisy and crowded because of the many restaurants and hotel nearby
It has lots of Restaurants and Bar
It also has many street food vendors which give a taste of Thai food
During Weekend place is very crowded and happening
Expensive crowded dirty beach unfriendly (sellers) people who want just take the money from the tourists to do nothing   
The time is here now never  ever back again
my time and my money without  stress
all kind off services are offered from drinks food
Also All kind of recreations available from Jet Ski's Para Sailing Banana Boat Sea Gliders etc
Good place to hangout for the evening and late into the night
Offers many selection of pubsbars and eat outs
to be more suited to younger people

a prize and follow them to collect  It's for
to party its the place to go
lots of bars and nightclubs

We brought a tent though there are umbrellas available
We tried the parasailing be sure
Nice place to relax  
spend time with family  
the beach is good to just sit and people watch
and something to eat and watch the world go by
The best place to relax with your partner
We were there for 5 days and enjoyed to the fullest
and read a book get a massage by the beach
it can be scorching hot during the midday and afternoon
like the enclosure of a 5 star resort you should warn you that when you are swimming you will be swimming next to bottles and coconut shells and random garbage floating about  
are extremely inexpensive trips out to the surrounding islands and you
The beach is windy and the water is not that calm
Everything is within walking distance here many nice affordable hotels around and tourpackage booth here can provide a good quotation for your entire holiday in Phuket
great for fun with friends beautiful
girls highly recommended short or long holiday remains
The positives are the beach is clean the water is
The beach area is cordoned off so boats cant run you over
Everything is very close restaurants
I've never been to other beaches near patong beach
patong beach is
it is usually very crowded and noisy and not the best place to go if
However with all the beach vendors all the amenities of food drink and souvenirs are right at your fingertips
Patong beach is a beautiful white sand beach very clean and good place to relax
a Thai massage at the beach go for a swim enjoy parasailing windsurfing or jet skiing  
Lifeguards and activities on the beach including jet skiing and paragliding

Patong (Thai: ป่าตอง; rtgs: Pa Tong) refers to the beach and town on Phuket's west coast
resort on the island of Phuket and is the center of Phuket's nightlife
Given it is right at the end of Bangla Road it doesn't have
you experiences for the water activities on offer on the beach but its expected so you kind of get use to it
Lots of shopping and street food
Be cautious w food & beverages we all got sick from something
very helpful and friendly love seeing the banter
10 years old selling orchid necklaces saw them trying
to force them to buy and if
a little dirtier on the side
we found after being on the beach one day we had
bites on our legs and decided
see as usualthat the the tides were rough in the morning
we returned in the late night when
if one price is two expensive
the next one will not be just keep walking they come out of the woodwork when
The sand beach and water Nice to play by the shore
The sea a bit too rough for small kids
has banned loungers the beach is clear of vendors and back to a more natural state  
to spend a day in the sun
with the main road and Bangla Road and takes
It looks best at night when it's more quiet and you can't see the litter
find something he likes whether it is food entertainment or shopping
And if Patong is not enough: try the even crazier and cheaper option of Pattaya
you can enjoy para sailing  water scooter  surfing or a speed boat ride
Rates are quite competitive but do not forget to bargain else you will end up paying more
a fishing boat or parasail up and down the beach or even hire a hideously noisy jet ski  
The water is blue and swimming is pleasant although it is packed with foreign visitors
A beach with a lot of tourist and sea activities
as the beach is huge and a lot of food there as well
Beautiful beach but with the absailing  
to sit quietly this is not the beach
Very nice sand and sea!
Lovely good price to rent umbrellas 
Crowdedthere is food and juice  ice cream service ( not expensive)
it was amazing to see the beach cleaners in the morning sweep the whole beach clean of mess
Gone are the deck chairs replaced with beach matsso nice to see the beach again
Well Ive done it but was not overwhelmed by it
wouldn't make an effort to go for the beach alone Patong however is an
If a party is your goal this is the place
Bars loud music (mostly American) strippers happy hour prices all night and street vendors selling everything from toys to cigarettes
Its an awesome beach where we can do all kind of water sports activities
The view of the beach from top was really very nice
Ok there were too many beach
We liked to have beach beds

Hundreds of eating options water sports massages etc
Had a great chance to see
drinks with my boys while getting henna tattoos
This first beach visited by us in Thailand and feel
related after swim in and it's cool
and restaurants are available and fresh fruit juice is also nearbyA bit noisy at the end of the beach because it is
you stay on the top area of the beach it is quite and good to relax
Paton Beach is a beach but
Ko Samui is way cleaner and the waves calmer
My gosh the red flags were out every day of our week long visit
nearby but the beach itself was a disappointment
not much to say ordinary normal beach nice to walk around the area but i
go for swimming in it it wasn't encouraging
Towards the northern edge it is a bit rocky but
has heaps of accommodation and shops stalls food and activities
Beautiful beach spoilt by
so many tourists
The whole place is like a Russian
enclave full of touts
and hawkersthere are
many better beaches
place stayed at the best western patong only 10 mins walk to beach 
5 mins from all the night life if
Very happening and busy beach offering something for everyone
Water activities massage tattoo etc services available

The 90 mins is really 3 hours and it's all time share
Good public beach where you can go for a swim drink your beercoffee at cafesbars sunbathe (of course
to pay for a bench and umbrella or you can bring your own mat) clean and clear water
Locals doing what they do best this lyfestyle is something completely different to what you know!
A must see
I didn't pay for a lounge but went further away so I could
The water was not so clear which I found very disappointing but it was nice and warm to float in
as Patong and were very pleased that
We were looking for a peace and quiet but
i have ever met always happy and have
We could all learn something from the Thai and that is to
Tends to attract people that party a lot get drunk

It was crazier than anyone can possibly explain to you but

Full of colour traffic and smiles

the coast and stopped at the Jewellery Factory and the Cashew Nut Factory
After eating too much and one too many Mojitos we went to wait for Ben to fetch us for our trip back to the hotel
The patong beach is a beautiful stretch of land touching the sea
the cafes next to the beach
as many umbrellas as you needed to keep the sun off and they were reserved
People came around selling everything from spring rolls to corn on the cob to ice cream
You can go parasailing You can ride on
If you want seclusion and more privacy head to Karon Beach or Kata Beach
A fantastic beach with lots of water activities available
so you can have your drinks brought to you
Patong beach is not the white sand gorgeous stuff you see in the photos  
great beaches in Thailand you will have to go to the islands away from
for a steak at this restaurant which was lovely to be honest
we always came out very happy and we did
A nice busy beach with lots of activity with all sorts of water sports going on and an area set aside for swimming
Lots of food and other
The only downside are the numerous
Loads of people from all walks of life
Really busy atmosphere locals kept asking if we would want to see ping pongsexy show walking through
which was off putting
we found the beach to be clean and pleasant
It was a bit busy but not overcrowded
The beach is actually not as pretty as others
It is the nearest to the town but there is nothing
We paid for lounge chairs nearly every day it was so so relaxing
The water on the first day was nice but a storm rolled through and the water was littered with rubbish
to many hotels and the party area  
We hated being asked to buy stuff every 5 minutes (wish I was exaggerating)  
a great relief instead of sitting on the sandYou
drinks and food on the beach special
Patong beach is lovely to visit during the day for a nice refreshing swim in the heat but that
and due to all the activities going on in the water (parasailing jetskiing kayaking etc) there are dedicated areas
the beach is clean
The walk way is very good and well illuminated at night
to eat along the beach
The annoying thing here too are the aggressive people trying to get
their product or to try on their suit or to eat at their restaurant
Message sun lounges activities coconut water it
to huge tourists but still fun experience
I like patong beach  it holds great memory for me in sense of nature & relaxation  there are lots of activities provided there and u will have great time  this beach had one of the best sunset
I ever seen ( photos attached )
This is the main beach in patong and it is a huge beach  
and the vibe in the town of Patong is
to dislike about it at all
Good Prices for beach beds and very friendly beach bar staff
A very good place to visit
Would highly recommend a visit you won't be disappointed
loved the water it was very
water up to what ever all ways nice to sellers
beach was worth being dere
Unlike beach of coh leh island of Pattaya waves were dere
Hot sunny beach for a great tan
Approached by many jet ski operators
the time mostly day time
I was there for couple hours to see the beach
and there are so many other lovely beaches in Thailand to visit  
to people watch this is probably
Patong beach is one of the popular beaches in the island of phuket
There are lots of restaurants live music shopping massage etc along the beach side road
If you like a bit of privacy then
During the day you will not see much of it anyways :)
the beach is amazing shallow so you can walk out
water was very clean and sand as well  
you can do shopping with familyfriendscouples safelybargaining shopping speciallymany indian restrothere
where all phuket sightseeing can be easily
We went to pattaya last year and it was ok the
also the day trips to beautiful island and great activities
A bit manic compared to most Thai beaches  
very clean just a bit busy for us  
The beach itself is OK with a lot of dining options so you can have your linch without actually leaving the beach
However the water is rather dirty  which is the main parameter for my family so after visiting Kata (and especially Kata Noi)
We spent a month going to the beach everyday which was always fabulous  
We went to number 39 and were looked after by the boys all the time  
This is like a 6th street in
Avoid the ping pong shows and just watch
We went to the north end of Patong beach
A few stores selling drinks and food nearby with coconut coating 50 THB
Lovely long beach to walk along or to sit and sunbath there are boat trips from the beach along with jet skiing and various other water sports
If your after a beach get a tuk
you somewhere nicer
They have beds on the beach
And the beach was nice (it has waves) and clea n
On our second day me and my friend were having fun in the water and were playing when we saw poop (fresh) floating in the water!!
Allinall it was fun stay there as we were determine not to spoil our vacation
Umbrella & chair rentals water sports activities food and refreshment vendors and kiosks etc
In general given the beautiful sand and water they are mindlessly
Patong Beach among them parasailing waterskiing and wake boarding
However that does not deter visitors who want to enjoy
It is also within walking distance to Bangla Road and Jungceylon Shopping Mall
Plenty to do on this beach
Lots of activities and great vibe
You can sit and watch or join in the fun
Not the best beach i ever seen but not bad at all
i appreciate the thai massage on the beach and the food delivery directly
The beach is long and clean
2020 it was comfortable  not many people but it wad due
to virus  Chnese did noit come
a short stroll from our hotel it was pretty clean there was a bit of rubbish that was getting washed up but this got cleaned away
There was a lot of water crafts in the water so we didn't
A shame that the Gay area is gone but still good to relax at the beach
Hope to came back soon there
you want to lie on your front
Just my opinion but am sharing it!
to set down your towel and lie down ( maybe not a sneed though as they appear to have been
tons to se and do and just opposite Bangle Road there's
and hostels on the main road so if you wanted
to stay on the main road
Perth I know a nice beach when I see one and this is a nice beach
to keep you entertained and there’s hundreds of bars and restaurants lined up across
of stay is in the most happening beach in Phuket you can't miss this one
Lot of hotels and restaurants
you left and right and there was no exception to the rule
my accommodation through the area having ping pong show menu showed in your face not once
Patong beach is nothing to write about home to our friends
Not so clean water lots of people trying to selling
Too MANY Caucasians and they are all trying to
find a place to lie down and suntan
Full of people that want to lure
do not bring children even for adults this
On my visit in December to patong beach the last thing i expected to stand on in the water was
the beach you would not dare swim in it
5 minutes on this beach and had to leave
I was continuously offered jet ski rides parasailing jewellery and even hassled to pay for a lounger
beach and town horrible smells and dirty!!I do not understand people
I do not want to come back here !!
It also smells especially at sunset
to avoid this beach
These beach is dirty and a bit choppy along with annoying hagglers and rubbish along it
For a decent beach get out of patong and go to surin or paradise beach
Actually I didn't expect good beach in Patong the ocean is not beautiful like a paradise beach
Maybe the others beachs like
I stayed in the Amari hotel on the hill and this was fine although
The beach itself is dirty and crowded the town even dirtier and more crowded
This street and Bangla road run together so I call them the same road
never subtle nothing else to do on thos street anymore
The massage was performed by a rather sulky unpleasant woman who was rather slipshod unprofessional and provided the worst quality massage we had ever experienced
Patong beach massage providers (ie done by the sea on the sand) like the plague
There were almost hundred of thousands of tourists on the beach
joggers were having difficulty jogging on the beach due to millions
Patong Beach is the most busy but it is not the cleanest
Karon beach and taking a Tuk Tuk to Patong for one evening rather than stay there
Gone are the days of tuktuks lining the whole street especially around the Starbucks area
to move by the tuktuk mafia now!
The road by the beach is very
busy and noisy so it's not an idilic
You can lay on the beach without umbrella's and cushion if you wish
You can sit at the vendors stall for free if
Not a place to stay if you’re over that scene (ie older than 23) and want to enjoy
There are plenty of day trips to many stunning places in the vicinity but it felt like we were escaping Patong (much to my relief)
No sun beds so ppl at the beach seemed to be at a lost!
If u patronise the beach restaurant for drinks or food
u can have the tables and chairs as you'd relax area
Went to try it out stayed
1 hour no more had to get away to many russians what have the thia's
for a paradise beach you aren't going to find it here
Plastic bags and litter floating in the water as well as on the beach
Bins appear to be an alien concept in Thailand
Kata Nai Harn Surin and Bangtao would be better choices  
Too crowded waters weren't crystal clear and dirty
The water is crowded with speedboats and longtail boats waiting to get clients on board parasailers and motoskiers so when you get in the water you're more
If you want to enjoy the beach you need to go very early in the morning at 10 it
The Beach is  not so Clean not Clear
Too much umbrellas on the Beach
No overcrowding here but the harassment from the peddlers is an absolute joke
The water is nice but loads of trash in the water that
Constant harrassment from touts for stupid toys fruit massages overpriced thai boxing etc
I want to lay here and sunbathe in peace!
Where's the clear blue water I saw in all the Brochures before
dirty brown water and one end of the beach just stunk of dirty garbage not to mention the rubbish on the beach
Beach was frequently grubby particularly after a storm
Water not very clean a little disappointing
this place is not for you
2 stars only because this is not my type of place
Not one of the nice beaches of Phuket
you go very early in the morning otherwise there are better beaches
rows and rows of deck chairs people trying to sell
you all sorts of rubbish noisy jet skis prossies and their customers used syriunges lying around this is the worst beach in Thailand
In relation to going to Patong beach (The BEACH ONLY  not the nightlife) here are the Pro's and the Con'sPROS  Close to the nightlife and
However what you don't know if that the jetski has scratches and scrapes all over it and the thais have covered it in
Everyone there is trying
n soak up in the sun this is not the place
Unfortunately Patong Beach is looking more
and more like Pattaya Beach:
Murky waters plastics and other debris floating everywhere
place usual tourist things going on the water isnt the best looked
dirty from were we use to walk to and from
My plan was to check out the Banzaan market walk through the mall and then hang out at the beach until the sun went down  
I realize most of the shops restaurants and food stands are the same
dirty and people are very insistent
dodgy at night as well would not walk here at all
for the terrible customer service we experienced from the shop keepers
I thought would be Thailand was lost in the bad customer service and lack of Thais
I was here yesterday and from the minute we stepped onto the foreshore
When we got to the water line there was rubbish everywhere
 water was very dirty in swimming area
we were very disappointed however jetsking and parasailing were interesting!All in all i would prefer
2 jet ski and one jet ski got turned in the water and we were drowning 
not safe to jet ski there 
I was so disappointed when ı saw that beachit was too crowded to relax too many day beds were placed
who wants to have fun next to beach that's all
to swim but the water did not seem very clean quite murky if you like and there was rubbish litter everywhere
It was red flag all the time and no one was around on the life
The beachtown was kind of dirty and the water wasn't as clear as we expected
We spent 4 days in Patong and did a day trip to Phi Phi
ie Patong Kalim Kamala Surin Bang Tao Karon Kata every beach was dirty with rubbish
I never saw anyone cleaning the beaches this place is advertised a Beach Paradise!!!
I visited 10 years ago and really enjoyed Patong however this paradise beach
We went for a swim as quickly as we eagerly entered the water we existed as myself and three kids were covered in rubbish
The southern end of the beach is
The middle of the beach might be OK re battery levels but there is more
Hire a scooter and go south of the island to the beautiful
has pristine clear water and the only vendors tend
Anyway we started playing and she seemed to be kicking the ball far and wide
you want to engage in sex tourism  If not and you wang to charm women the way if
too pushy and busy  
almost punched out some
to make people aware of the dangers of swimming in the waters of Patong Beach  
has even reported november of 2013 the pollution levels in the
Dirty beach and with way too many people
I Think there are better beaches where to go
Very dirty and busy beach
There are many much better beaches in
road tons of potential shopping but most of them without a price tag
to negotiate and in the end when they say yes you will feel scammed 
When you imagine Thailand beaches  That is not the one
There are plenty of better beaches around
and fraud here and there
dirty and very small
Lots of bars lots of crazy lots of noise
I was on with my husband this was not my favorite place
Way to many tourists to much sex industry and WAY to high prices  
Been there in high
and low season no different
The water itself was colder then expected and the beach was dirty
the coast of this island  much better more secluded beaches
This beach town is not for ocean beach lovers  
wearing thongs with drinks in hand but for quiet enjoyment of the seashore forget it
I spent half an hour there and left because there are some better beaches we can find in
Many restaurants and bar nearby and many taxis too  
and prostitutes that primarily make a living by robbing and stealing
Please dont go to patong you will be robbed abused asualted and constently harasd
of people trying to sell
you rubbish… backpackers everywhere
The attraction to Patong is the vibe and one has to look past the obvious overcrowded streets and often smelly streets!
The beach this time however was littered with plastic bags and when swimming in the sea I found myself untangling litter from around
The smell when you go over the sewage is gross
10000 Bhat was at Phi Phi and bamboo beach in 45 min right from the beach
Too poo much uh people to a not so good and clean beach
you are 20 to 30 or more single and you want
A rubbishbin full of plastic bags garbages etc invaded of chinese
who spend time taking photos and blocked by parasailing activities jet ski etc One of the most awful and dirty beach i've seen
We spent the rest of our time in Patong by the pool in our hotel before going on to a quieter cleaner part of Thailand
A very different (and disappointing) place to what we visited just over 9 years ago
off taking the island hopping package
Nice place to watch the sunset though
Patong is awful a place for noisy and booze lover turists (mainly Aussies Americans and Russians)
"They could be anywhere else and feel the same they are just drinking and going to ""massage"" parlours"
karon beach more than patong beach
Patong beach is more dirty and
dirty and there are a lot of people
If you want to see some
decent beaches arange a boat tour and there are some stunning ones in the area
on the way to somewhere but
of one of the most bustling parts of the town
The sand is not the most pristine and the water is not the clearest
station at the beach end of Bangla Road every half hour
has rubbish and plastic in the sea and beach
Mostly food and loud entertainment with many restaurants offering the same stuff
You see one you see all
experience but for repeated visitors patong beach is too highly commercialised
Even if your asleep they will nudge u  annoy you &
You know how big issue sellers  beggars annoy
This beach is dirty and over crowded
you are into the rowdy tourist scene
Why would anyone want to come to this beach
so many other stunning beaches in Phuket and Thailand  
Patong beach was very dirty and had loads of rubbish floating in the water
The beaches at Kata and Karon are much nicer and cleaner
Prefer not to come or choose another beach
Let the picture do the talking
This is first scam  only taxi can take
Costing 450  baht it is 20 min drive 
Not the best of Thailand reminds me the worse of Spanish beacheswe only stayed for one night
There are so many beautiful and quieter beaches not far from here but
Dont go to Pstong unless your under 30
No longer a relaxing place to be for a holiday unless
Few and far between of hiring shaded sunbeds on beach
Phuket could be a beautiful place for tourists unfortunately it is now ruled
Do not waste your hard earned money on Phuket try Vietnam Cambodia or Laos
They don't want us here and I don't want to come here ever again
to find anywhere to lay a towel and sunbath
you've found somewhere the para sale guys set up and blow whistles
Further south at Kata the water is clearer and less crowded
an ugly dirty over crowded beach with allot of undesirables here
I like Patong BEach but that
They are all the same and keep talking for some reason when you
The sooner the dodgy businesses close the better
If you are going to Thailand to emerse
on the planet there is no reason to go to Patong
"At night the famous street has the ""clubs and shows"""
We walked along the beach in the evening and it was crowded
We visited Patong beach last week and couldn't wait to get back to Karon  
way to busy smelly and the beach locals are pushy at trying to sell
the corner from the beach
The beach is busy and you have to cross the road
and annoyed by touts and scammers
Not a place to go and relax with the family
Patong beach in my opinion is one of the craziest beaches i have visited  
you not to take them there as it can scar them
It smelled sewers there was garbage all over the place and we were harassed by
We were glad to get out of that tourist zoo where old white men get hooked up with teenager girls
The place is becomming a second Pattaya over crowded with low budget
I have seen the place going down hill by the years   at
Patong is good to see of a night for a hour or so and that's it
to take children of a night in Bangla road  and you will get the locals coming up to you offering ping pong shows and
I used to go to the Gay Beach Part (where the lifesaver's cottage is)
and often when in the water plastic bags plastic wrappers and even pieces of sht would float around you  
you everything when all I wanted was to sit on the beach and swim a bit
I hope this is not Thailand as a whole
It is by far the most expensive place i have visitedt in Thailand
my room safe in the hotel i was staying at by one of the cleaners (LOTUS HOTEL)I have recently travelled
and hard to walk or swim on the beach
There was rubbish everywhere and the water was horrible with plastic bags and floating debris
They are lots of tout Steer clear of the jet skiers
"A popular scam You touch the already broken item the guy running the ""business"" will say you broke it and attempt to make you empty your wallet for his very new machine"
A go go street so many bar like pattaya it too much i
6 year a go yas night but not any more
There are much better places to be in Thailand than
who has all the money and most restaurant serve Indian or Arabic food
when you picture thai beaches
you think crystal clear water and white sand 
 better go to phi phi if
It’s crowded dirty and seedy with all the jet ski and parasailing operators vying for business
The water also looks dirty
I don’t see what the appeal is
and natural without the beach chairs
the beach and every step
Even in the water a number of times plastic wrappers attached themselves to me
The area was filled with tourist  but the
trashy and not really our scene at all
It's over crowded loud feels tacky
This beach and surrounding area is way below par
We found Patong Beach to be busy and dirty with many people hassling you to buy things
a street merchant putting sunglasses or cards in your face
It is sad the toursits have destroyed a beach that
the time travelling 10 minutes in either direction to freedom beach Kamala or Karon if
a beach and need convenience as this is near Bangla road the Jungceyleon shopping and Patong hotels then stick with this and stay in the middle of the beach it is the cleanest part because locals have chaise loungers
you with stuff every 5 minutes trash
on and in the sand and with the road right behind
This beach is awful very overcrowded!!
We were staying in Karon but popped to Patong one afternoon
McDonald's KFC etc the Magaluf of Thailand!
you are looking to relax
This is not a suitable place with young
to avoid the dust caused by the parasailing
Never ever under any circumstances ever go to Patong
Once you are there you will do anything to leave
You will extorted by taxi drivers at some ridiculous charge
Phuket beaches the water is cloudy and dirty looking
It's quite pretty at night when the sun sets over the water and you can't see the filth
The whole of Patong is a filthy mess
the place is jumping and it is a great place
the small market there where the clothes are of reasonable
They also have some sea activities including one where people are strapped to a parachute type device and pulled by a jet ski
Go to Patong for everything but the beach it is absolutely
 I wouldn't consider swimming there it's tiny it's nothing but vendors selling crappy goodsexperiences
Patong Beach is not only overrun with tourists but
also with people practically assaulting you to try and get
both around the beach and along the frontage of the beach then
However along much of the road rubbish is ignored by the locals but
Best to go to Kata or Kamala beach
I prefer going to  
by time of year but too many floating things like plastic paper
a good swim and time in the water get a lift to karong beach which is magic and only
way better places to go to than Phuket and the gangsters are not  Thailand people  
northern European peoplethere is way  more too see in krabi chaing mai river kwai koh somai and pattaya is just as bad
payfor umbrellas and cigarette butts with the constant droning of jetskis out on the water go here
On the other hand if you want a picturesque beach a good look at the wonderful Thai culture and people a chance to wind down and see what this part of the world has to offer then go somewhere anywhere other than here
lily an awful place with so many things wrong with it
Cheap tacky and very nasty and full of old preying on girls dancing on the bars
Dirry filthy beach with hawkers selling anything and everything  
Even when you refuse they still hound
However being in Patong it's overcrowded and not very clean
particularly enjoy it and couldn't wait to leave
The beach is a little bit crowdy and the sea is definetly the worst in Phuket
Try Karon and Kata beach instead
City Beach next
to a crowdy road lots of garbage at the beach as all over Thailands beaches!
Very noisy definitely a party animal place but not for me  
But for the young who want to part with their money and drink lots of booze
lovely for an evening stroll much cooler and enjoyable
Vendors offer everything from tours fruit clothing massages ski boats etc
The comfort of having shade by using sun chairs with umbrellas had been removed
This was later replaced by mats and umbrellas but still the
Patong Beach is the largest of the beaches on the west coast of Phuket or at least the busiest by all standards
Patong itself is the most partyoriented area in Phuket so if you want
too crowed and very commercial  
to find a place to lie and enjoy the ambience
to get your own deck chair umbrella and looked after
It lost its own colour
We didn't even go in the water
Still warm and lots to do but
facing beach can be very rough and has a lot of rubbish on it
Suggest you try beaches on the east side of the island
we made a wrong decision the minute after arriving in Patong (actually the minute when we stepped outside the airport)
"The worst bit was the harassment  on very single road every corner and on the beach every 2 seconds ""Taxi"
As we stayed in Holiday Inn resort which was just opposite the Patong beach we were hopeful of having a nice time at this famous beach
which are also expensive as compared to other beach locations
Trash everywherehalf of the people in the
beach are annoying salesman
Find a space and set up a business seems
Looking for relaxationpeace and quiet AVOID
I really hesitated to go into the water and did not do that actually
The people involving the business regarding to the beach should realize that
These thai men work on the beach robbing and scamming
The police are in on the scam as well so DO NOT HIRE
The majority of the beach is taken up by paragliding and jet ski teams with lots of areas off limits to swimming
Then the tide went out and to our horror the beach was littered with plastic cups bags and debris which is what we were swimming in
to the beach too with the result that tbe water is brown
Phuket: try Kamala beach Karun beach and Kata beach
We were two families with small children planning to spend a couple of hours on the beach
We offered to clean the bed but that didn't stop the verbal abuse it seemed pre meditated and an opportunity to make
it was old style (yes 39 years in fact) and still solid and he recommended leaving it
Couldn't get back to the quieter pace of the Thalang
of people swimming and laying out there was trash EVERYWHERE in and out of the water and the
We kept walking north to see if it improved but the only difference was the amount of hawkers and people in general increased  
like a suit a taxi a massage a tuk tuk a moped English breakfast to buy a wallet maybe some fake diamonds in
Brits abroad in the truest sense like Ayia Napa or Ibiza of the East
If that is what you want then go  you will have heaps of opportunities to see “f ing show”
Sadly there isn’t much else to see
a night on Bangla road drinking in the midst of headsplitting music
coming from all angles and disgusting womenladyboys trying
a beach with less people and less harassment from vendors and restauranteurs
up and dirty I can't imagine anyone wanting to actually stay and spend time there
whether that be simply because of the alcoholic haze and the ensuing hangover
a veritable army of hawkers selling (at an inflated price compared to other areas in Phuket) everything the sort of tourist who would enjoy
Patong beach is an example how the massive tourism and the cheap touristic development can destroy nature’s beauty
Except if massive tourism is what you
you sell something
you are napping they will wake you
IThe beach is dirty the sea is
The biggest waste of money ever!!Ps: if u are thinking to go to Phy Phy Island
Never did go during day time because I lost interest of going there after a early night visit and walked along the beach
for around 15 mins it was nice and dark but too much trash
It's either hot smelly and dirty or hot raining smelly and dirty!
five people why on earth would we say yes to you!  
other reviewers can rate the beach and cleanliness of the sea so highly having seen and smelt the surrounding streets
of Patong and the smell coming up from the sewers and
Beach is dirty water is dirty jet sky boys
pls don t come at this shore
Well they almost do as all the Europeans Aussies and Americians have left
for a better time to Kata and Karon to the south
as the emphasis is on removing it from you  
cleaned every morning so early on it looks lovely from a distance  
55 Baht in Patong that is more than what they charge in the US or perhaps in Europe  
that costs below 100 baht is considered
The water off the beach is pretty polluted
Thailand is famous for you need to get about 30 minutes off shore
of garbage on the beach and washing up in the water
You're better off going to one of the neighboring islands and staying there while enjoying a clean beach area
my room broke the lock and robbed some of my credit cards and cash
my stolen credit cards it was still one of my horrible travel experience
a major prize and try and get you to go in a taxi to a hotel
you there to try and sign
over powering once a firm no thank you!!A lot of the beach is taken up by
Also saw several people be hassled for so called damage when returning jet ski
If you want to be hasselled and harrassed then go to this beach
The beach also is not the cleanest beach on the island and you better
go to another beach like Karon Beach or
The sea is brown the beach is dirty
You can go to Paradise beach o freedom beach
Once again I'm diassappointed with the much heralded beaches here
It was filthy and with all the local non eco friendly boats I certainly wouldn't want to swim in the sea
Water is murky there is an open sewer on one end
 to many sellers trying to push chair rental massages or else
don't consider it the best there are much better beaches both in Phuket and Australia
Patong beach is filthy dirty plastic bags & bottles everywhere syringes clothing condoms u name it you can find it in the water or on the beach
and they are ruining it
so completely flabbergasted by the truly gross scene there it just ruined the stay
"Less ""discovered"" Thailand means that the environment has not been destroyed and that the atmosphere is very laid back and quiet"
 I dont understand why anyone would want to go here unless they are into heavy drinking and the vices of Bangla
why anyone would go here there are so many places in the world
Ao Sane beach because the smell the vendors every 10' every restaurant asking
The smell is the worst
One of the worst beach i have seen in ThailandCrowded dirty water limited swiming areajelky fish
Long chair staff not nice
